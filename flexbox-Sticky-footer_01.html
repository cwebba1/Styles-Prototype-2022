Just a reminder that absolutely no one is doing just fine right now.
8:15 AM · Jul 13, 2022·Twitter Web App

While I don't intentionally set out to do it, I find myself discussing mental health with pretty much anyone I converse with. I feel it's absolutely critical to articulate the challenges we're all facing, and to normalize having frank and candid conversations about it.

With each conversation — whether it's with a friend, colleague, family member, or stranger — you can almost see a physical weight being lifted off of them as they have their struggles recognized and validated. It is incredibly cathartic and fosters such healthy human connection.

All of us ought to have more opportunities to discuss our emotional weight, and to be there for others as they share theirs with us. The pandemic has stolen many of these opportunities from us: the coffee date, going out for a beer, back yard hangs.

You're not kicking ass right now, and it's not your fault. It's not some personal deficiency that you need to overcome. Our emotional selves have been pent up for years now, which goes against our very human nature. Recognize and acknowledge the terrible situation for what it is,

And give yourself permission to be gentle with yourself. And while we're at it, let's all be a bit more gentle with each other; we're all going through some shit.
